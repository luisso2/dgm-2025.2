## Project Summary Description

 <!-- **Description of the project theme, including generating context and motivation:** -->
   This project addresses the challenge of personality trait classification based on the OCEAN (Big Five) model, using the First Impressions dataset from ChaLearn. The OCEAN model is a theoretical framework widely adopted in psychology to describe personality across five major dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. The dataset provides short video clips annotated with OCEAN-based personality traits, enabling computational models to infer psychological characteristics from visual and behavioral cues.
    A key motivation of this project lies in the class imbalance present in the dataset, which impacts the performance and generalization of machine learning models. To mitigate this issue, we propose the use of generative models to create synthetic images, aiming to balance the distribution of classes and improve the robustness of predictive models.
 
 <!-- **Description of the main goal of the project:** -->
  The main goal of the project is to develop and evaluate a generative model capable of producing synthetic face images aligned with specific OCEAN traits. By generating additional data for underrepresented categories, the project seeks to reduce dataset imbalance and enhance the accuracy and fairness of personality trait classification tasks.
  
 <!-- **Clarify what the output of the generative model will be:** -->
  The output of the generative model will be a set of synthetic facial images conditioned on OCEAN trait labels, which will complement the original First Impressions dataset. These synthetic samples will be used to balance the dataset, supporting downstream tasks of training and validating classification models for personality prediction.

## Proposed Methodology
<!-- > For the first submission, the proposed methodology must clarify:   -->
<!-- **Which dataset(s) the project intends to use, justifying the choice(s)** -->
   The project will use the ChaLearn First Impressions V2 dataset, which contains ten thousand of short video clips annotated with the OCEAN (Big Five) personality traits. This dataset was chosen because it is one of the most widely recognized and publicly available benchmarks for automatic personality recognition. Its annotations are directly aligned with the OCEAN model, ensuring consistency with the theoretical framework adopted in this project.
<!-- **Which generative modeling approaches the group already sees as interesting to be studied** -->
   The group considers Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in large-scale implementations as an interesting approach to be studied. GANs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in producing high-quality and realistic facial images, which aligns with the project’s goal of generating synthetic samples for balancing the dataset. Large-scale GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN or BigGAN, offer improved stability during training and enhanced capacity to model fine-grained details, making them suitable for the complexity of facial data. Additionally, conditional versions of GANs (cGANs or AC-GANs) can be explored to generate synthetic images aligned with specific OCEAN personality traits, ensuring the relevance of the generated data for the downstream classification task.

  * Data & Preprocessing: OpenCV and FFmpeg for frames extraction, NumPy and Pandas for data handling.
  * Evaluation: Scikit-learn for discrimination metrics, FID/KID for synthetic image quality evaluation.
<!-- **Expected results** -->
  As expected results, we address three main themes. First, data generation, which involves creating synthetic facial images conditioned on OCEAN traits using GAN-based models to provide a balanced extension of the First Impressions dataset. Second, model performance, where we anticipate improved classification accuracy and fairness across OCEAN traits, leading to more robust models due to reduced data imbalance. Finally, evaluation, in which we expect quantitative improvements measured by FID and KID for image quality, alongside higher accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC in downstream classification tasks.
<!-- **Proposal for evaluating the synthesis results** -->
   To evaluate the synthesis results, the project will combine quantitative, qualitative, and downstream-task-based approaches. Quantitative evaluation will rely on established metrics such as FID, KID, and LPIPS, which measure the quality, diversity, and perceptual similarity of the generated images. Qualitative evaluation will include visual inspection to verify coherence between synthetic samples and their intended OCEAN traits.
   Finally, the most important evaluation will be the impact of synthetic data on the downstream classification task: models trained with the balanced dataset (real + synthetic) will be compared to baseline models, using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC as key performance indicators. This multi-faceted evaluation ensures both the realism of the generated data and its practical utility for personality trait prediction.
